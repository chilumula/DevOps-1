<p>Flat-Remix is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and free open source theme for your computer. Flat remix is a pretty simple icon theme inspired on material design. It is mostly flat with some shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth and uses a colorful palette with nice contrasts.</p>
<p>It has been designed on gnome shell 3.24 but it should work with most linux distributions, under gnome, unity, cinnammon, xfce, kde, etc.
This theme was made to fit with the Flat Remix GNOME theme.</p>
